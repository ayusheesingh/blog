## January Dump
I wanted to start a blog for the longest time but now that I have, I am kind of stressed/confused on what I want to put on here?? so it will be random. I'll try to update this whenever I do something cool or want to share something exciting I've read or explored. Since it's still the first month of the year, I'll try to remember some things that have happened until now :grin: 

This month, I started to get into a routine of going to Corepower Yoga for their 7:30am class and got their All-Access membership for a month but put a pause to it when I got COVID :cold_face: My friend also goes to the gym regularly and lives very close to me, so I might just try to go with her for a bit until my Corepower starts up again in a month (so annoying that the shortest amount of time I can freeze my membership for is a month). I've tried getting more settled into my life in San Francisco and even furnished my place a lot more by getting a rug, TV stand, nesting tables, and balcony furniture and tiles. It seems like a lot of people are starting to move here, so I'm excited to reconnect with old friends and meet up with new ones :)

### Books
I started to use my Goodreads account again and started getting back into reading thanks to some intriguing TikTok recommendations, some of which I really enjoyed: 
* We Were Liars (mid 2021)
    * i loved this book bc super short and unexpected plot twist in the end
* The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo (Nov 2021)
    * honestly very disappointed after all the hype around it because it didn't have that "plot twist" that I love, but it was definintely an interesting and different read
* Every Last Secret (Dec 2021)
    * fun to read but honestly not that "exciting" of a story - more just about the characters and their personalities
* It Ends With Us (Jan 2022)
    * i liked this book bc plot twist but also it came full circle which wrapped up the book really well
* Verity (Jan 2022) 
    * LOVEd this book - it was creepy, super interesting, had me constantly confused throughout and overall an awesome book especially the way it had me thinking about it for days even after I had finished it

### Movies
* The Incredibles
    * awkward that this was my first time watching but obviously loved it - immediately caught the origins of so many TikTok sounds on here oops
* The Incredibles 2
    * so exciting 2 watch
* Under the Tuscan Sun
    * what was this idk a life story?? self discovery?? my own fault for watching a random movie without watching trailer or looking at reviews. it was chill but nah would not watch again or recommend

### TV Shows
* Formula 1
    * best show ever filled with beautiful european men and gets you excited about f1 racing <3 my new obsession
* Too Hot to Handle (S3)
    * dumb i watched bc friend told me to and i saw S1 but that was so much more drama - this was def more wholesome vibes but it was kind of annoying to watch bc the same ppl kept losing money for the group and the one dude who lost so much $$ ended up "GRowiNG" a lot ?? no so fake hated it all the couples ended up breaking up in real life anyway so stupid
* Euphoria
    * can never watch this by myself - makes me way too uncomfortable but I watch 4 the culture :pray:
* Succession
    * hated when i watched it for the first time but i think it needs to grow on me for a bit so giving her a second chance
* Flack
    * watched a long time ago but recently remembered it and finished - i kind of like it it's diff than other shows but still drama and fun

### Restaurants
* Bamboo Sushi (San Ramon)
    * sushi was good, but hot sake was very painful
* Iza Ramen (SF)
    * it was ok i can't really judge ramen like it was fine
* Bao (SF)
    * some things here were so YUMMY but others were average - definitely order the sesame baos, fried chicken potstickers, mango and shrimp rolls, shanghai noodles, and the COCONUT BUNNY!!
* Fiorella (SF)
    * pretty average italiano foodo. i accidentally went to the wrong location - I think the Sunset location is much better


Honestly, I didn't even realize I did so much this month until now - maybe I'll do this monthly dump of things I forget about hmmm
