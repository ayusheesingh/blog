## Santa Barbara
I've realized that I travel a lot and never remember where I've been or what I've done, so I will try to remember and recap my trips here now xD. First up is Santa Barbara!
I drove down with my parents (for about 5 hours) from Pleasanton to Goleta (which is ~12 min drive to SB). We're here on the occassion that it's President's Day, but in 
actuality we're staying here for an entire week =D

### Day 1: Drive Down (2/17)
Today we drove for five hours to our Airbnb in Goleta (which is ~12 min drive to Santa Barbara). The drive honestly felt long before I even got into the car, but overall
I didn't really feel the time or distance during the ride. My eyes were definitely fried from looking at a screen, and today I played so many variations of Wordle
that my brain was exhausted too. 

No screen time = Araali time! 

I let my father pour out his pitches and thoughts and updates about his company to keep him from looking at his phone when he was driving, which actually 
worked out pretty well until he started to get antsy around halfway through the roadtrip. I had to hold my pee for an hour because I am a strong woman, and
we reached our place around 7pm. The Airbnb itself definitely seems a little old but is pretty clean and livable, which I like. There are a bunch of lights and books
and games here, so I'll definitely be entertained for the week even though I have work for 2 of the days I'm here. I went through the bookshelf and am hoping
to try to read a lot during this trip because it's been a while since I've read real paper books how sad tbh but anyway I think my Goodreads is missing me =P
